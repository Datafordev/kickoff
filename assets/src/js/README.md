Kickoff has a very simple folder structure for itâ€™s JavaScript; as a base Kickoff contains `utils`, `standalone` and a `modules` directories.

## modules
This directory is where you ought to put all your local, non-npm modules.

## utils
This directory is where you ought to put all your local utility scripts. These are the simple, single-serving scripts that are shared by more than one module.

## standalone
Any script/file in this directory will be copied, without modification, to the assets/dist/js/standalone directory. As an example, we added our Modernizr.js file here
