# LESS

Kickoff is made with Less](http://lesscss.org/) at its core, a dynamic stylesheet language created by our good friend, Alexis Sellier. It makes developing systems-based CSS faster, easier, and more fun.

### Why LESS?

One of Twitter Bootstrap's creators wrote a quick blog post about this, summarized here:

* Bootstrap compiles faster ~6x faster with Less compared to Sass
* Less is written in JavaScript, making it easier to us to dive in and patch compared to Ruby with Sass.
* Less is more; we want to feel like we're writing CSS and making Bootstrap approachable to all.

### What's included?

As an extension of CSS, LESS includes variables, mixins for reusable snippets of code, operations for simple math, nesting, and even color functions.

## Compiling Kickoff with Less

Since our CSS is written with Less and utilizes variables and mixins, it needs to be compiled for final production implementation. Here's how:

### Apps

#### [Crunch](http://crunchapp.net/)

Crunch is a great looking LESS editor and compiler built on Adobe Air.

#### [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/)

Created by the same guy as the unofficial **Mac** app, CodeKit is a **Mac** app that compiles LESS, SASS, Stylus, and CoffeeScript.

#### [Simpless](http://wearekiss.com/simpless)

**Mac**, **Linux**, and **Windows** app for drag and drop compiling of LESS files. Plus, the [source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/Paratron/SimpLESS).
